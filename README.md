# Nissan-Leaf-Battery-to-OBD2
An opensource solution for connecting OBD2 straight to a Nissan Leaf battery. Very useful gadget to have if you're thinking about buying a battery and want to check the state-of-health beforehand.

Please note, there are two versions of the 'Yazaki' connector found on Nissan Leaf batteries. The 2011-2012 version uses a 21-pin, and the 2013-2019 uses a 36-pin connector. At this stage, the 3d-printable files are only supporting the 36-pin connector. See the documentation folder for more details.

# How to make your own
It's really easy to make, you'll need the following items:
1. 3d-printed Yazaki connector, found in this repository
2. Dupont style connectors (found in most arduino kits or old PCs)
3. Superglue
4. An OBD2 port along with the pins (can be bought new or salvaged from a scrap car)
5. Wires to connect it all
6. A 12V power source (small lead acid battery does the trick OR a few 18650s in series)

# Detailed instructions
To start of with, gather all the parts needed. The Yazaki model found in this repository can be printed without supports. I printed it in PETG, but PLA/ABS can also be used. Once you have the model printed, attach dupont connectors to it by supergluing/epoxying them in place. Be careful not to get any glue inside the connector, especially the pins. Less is more here.
